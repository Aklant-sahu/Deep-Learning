# Practicing Deep Learning

This Deep learning folder consists the implementation of the 
following deep learning models.

1)Implementing FeedForward ANN  
2) Implementing Basic CNN Architetures.  
3) Implementing RNN networks to replicate a Servo's movement 
captured wrt Time.  
4) Testing various activation functions such as Relu,leakyRelu
,Sigmoid.  
5)Testing and seeing the effect of various optimizers such as 
Adam,gd,SGDetc.
